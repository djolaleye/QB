# QB

An introductory look into the common school of thought that a QB's performance is the most important factor to winning and losing games in the NFL.



'''
Conclusion: Passer rating on its own is not a reliable indicator of winning vs losing. 
Proper evaluation of the impact of a QBs performance's on winning should involve: 
    - replace rating with other stats
        - (QBR, EPA/dropback, DVOA)
    - features related to qb-independent offensive impact
    - features related to defensive impact
    - features related to special teams impact
    - features related to coaching impact
    - features related to environment (ex. elevation, weather conditions)
    - features related to off-field impact (ex. travel distance)
    - separate analysis on different game situations (ex: by quarter/half, trailing/leading)
    
Another direction could be to evaluate outcome based on the difference between opposing QB performance.
